# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Q1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwanted behaviour that makes someone feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected. Examples are:
- Physical contact like touching, patting, or blocking someone’s way.
- Verbal remarks like comments on appearance, offensive jokes, sexual jokes, or unwanted flirting.
- Non-verbal actions like staring, lewd gestures, showing inappropriate pictures/videos.
- Online harassment like sending offensive texts, images, or repeated unwanted messages.
-Abuse of power like offering benefits in return for favours or threatening someone’s job.

## Q2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

If you face or see harassment:
- Speak up if safe – Clearly say the behaviour is not acceptable.
- Document – Note details like date, time, place, people present.
- Report – Contact the Internal Committee (IC) at your company or HR as per the PoSH policy.
- Support others – If you see it happening, encourage the victim to report and stand as a witness if needed.
- Do not ignore – Even small repeated incidents should be reported, not tolerated.


## Q3 Explainers for different scenarios enacted by actors

- The videos show real-life situations (like unwanted jokes, comments, or touching) to help us understand what harassment looks like.
- They explain what is acceptable and what is not in a workplace.
- They also show the right way to respond — saying "No," reporting to HR/IC, or supporting colleagues. 

## Q4 How to handle cases of harassment?

- Tell the person clearly that their behaviour is not acceptable.
- Do not stay silent — report the incident to the Internal Committee (IC), HR, or your manager.
- Keep a record of what happened (date, time, place).
- Support anyone else who may be facing harassment.

## Q5 How to behave appropriately?

- Treat everyone with respect and dignity.
- Avoid making offensive jokes, comments, or gestures.
- Respect personal boundaries and personal space.
- Follow workplace rules and company PoSH policy.
- Create a safe and comfortable environment for all.
