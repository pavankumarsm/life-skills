# Tiny Habits 

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

#### Question 1: what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* The most interesting idea was how small actions can grow into big habits. For example, he shared that just doing two pushups after using the bathroom can grow into a bigger fitness habit. 
* It showed me that starting small is more powerful than forcing big changes.

#### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
BJ Fogg explains 
 B = MAP, which means:
* M = Motivation (how much you want to do it)
* A = Ability (how easy it is to do)
* P = Prompt (a reminder or trigger to do it)
To make new habits easier:
* Lower the difficulty (make it simple).
* Connect it to a clear prompt (like after brushing teeth).
* Don’t always rely on motivation because it goes up and down.

#### Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
It is important to celebrate after finishing a habit because emotions make habits stick. When you “shine” (smile, fist pump, say “Yes!”), your brain feels good and remembers the behavior. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit faster.

#### Question 4: what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The most interesting story was about how tiny improvements, just 1% each day, add up over time. Instead of chasing big changes, slow and steady small changes create big results in the future.

## 4.  Book Summary of Atomic Habits

#### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The book says identity is very important. Instead of saying “I want to run,” say “I am a runner.” When habits match your identity, they become stronger because you are proving to yourself who you are.

#### Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make a habit easier:
* Reduce the steps.
* Prepare in advance (keep water bottle near bed if you want to drink water).
* Make the habit so small that it feels simple to start.

#### Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To make a habit harder:
* Increase friction.
* Add more steps between you and the bad habit (for example, keep snacks on a high shelf, delete social media apps).
* Make it inconvenient so you don’t feel like doing it.
